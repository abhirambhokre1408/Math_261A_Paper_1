Overview

This project examines whether county-level physical inactivity is associated with adult obesity in U.S. counties (2023). I fit a simple linear regression of adult obesity (%) on physical inactivity (%), produce a scatter plot with the OLS fit/band, and report a tidy regression table and model-fit summary.
