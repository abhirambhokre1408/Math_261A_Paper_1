# Physical Inactivity and Adult Obesity in U.S. Counties  
**Author:** Abhiram Bhokre  
**Date:** October 2025  

## Project Overview

This project investigates whether county-level **physical inactivity** is associated with **adult obesity** across U.S. counties using data from the **2023 County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (CHR&R)** dataset.  

A **simple linear regression (SLR)** model was fitted with:
- **Dependent variable:** Adult obesity rate (% of adults with BMI ≥ 30)
- **Independent variable:** Physical inactivity rate (% of adults reporting no leisure-time physical activity)

The project quantifies the relationship between inactivity and obesity, checks model assumptions, and evaluates robustness using heteroskedasticity-consistent (HC1) standard errors.  

This paper and accompanying code were submitted as part of the **Regression Theory (Math 261A)** course at **San José State University**.

Each row in the dataset represents a U.S. county, including indicators on health outcomes and behaviors.  
For this analysis, only **adult obesity (%)** and **physical inactivity (%)** were used.

## Statistical Methods

The fitted model used for this analysis is a **Simple Linear Regression (SLR)** defined as:

```math
\text{Obesity}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1\,\text{Inactivity}_i + \varepsilon_i
```
where:

Obesityᵢ — Percentage of adults with BMI ≥ 30 in county i

Inactivityᵢ — Percentage of adults reporting no leisure-time physical activity

β₀ (Intercept) — Expected obesity percentage when inactivity is zero

β₁ (Slope) — Change in obesity (percentage points) per one–percentage–point increase in inactivity

εᵢ — Random error term capturing unobserved influences

## Use of LLMs

This project made limited use of **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to assist with:
- Initial brainstorming for research on project topic/dataset 
- Formatting the README, Quarto syntax, and LaTeX equations  

All analysis, code execution, interpretation, and writing decisions were independently verified by the author.
